# 📘 Machine Learning Journey — From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to my **Machine Learning learning journey** 🚀  
This repository documents my **step-by-step progress** as I learn **Machine Learning from scratch to advanced topics**, following a structured and in-depth course by **Krish Naik**.

This repo serves as a **learning log, practice workspace, and progress tracker**, where I push my **daily work, notebooks, and experiments** to maintain consistency and accountability.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Learn **Machine Learning systematically**, starting from:
  - Python fundamentals
  - Data analysis & statistics
  - Machine learning algorithms
  - Deep learning
  - NLP & Transformers
  - End-to-end ML & MLOps
- Practice concepts with **hands-on coding**
- Maintain a **daily GitHub contribution streak** as a motivation tool
- Build discipline and consistency in learning
- Create a **transparent learning timeline** that reflects my growth

This repository is **not a production library** — it is a **learning portfolio**.
